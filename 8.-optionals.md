# 8. Optionals

So far, we have learned about the variables and constants that we always initialize with data. What about we declare a variable without any data in it and try to use it, like the following:

```swift
var myInt:Int
print(myInt)
```

It will give us an error:

So, we cannot use a variable without initializing it, right?. Well, sort of. Swift allows us to keep the variables uninitialized. It is done using a special data structure called `Optional`. Optionals are declared by adding a `?` at the end, like the following:

```swift
var myInt:Int? //Optional Int
print(myInt)
```

It will print the following:

```
nil
```

First of all, `nil` means there is no value. It is equivalent to `null` in many other programming languages like Java. So we have to make sure we do not use an optional value if we haven't yet stored a value in it; otherwise, it might crash the program. Luckily, Swift handles optionals safely.

To understand the process, let's assign a value to `myInt` before we print it:

```swift
var myInt:Int?
//assigning a value...
myInt = 10
print(myInt) //prints Optional(10)
```

It prints `Optional(10)` instead of `10`. That means, the value of `myInt` is wrapped with the optional data type. By wrapping the value with Optional, Swift makes us unwrap the value before we use it. While unwrapping, we can detect if the unwrapped value is `nil` or not and take care of `nil` before we use it in the program to prevent crashes. There are three ways of unwrapping them.

* If-let
* Guard-let
* Forced

We will talk about `if-let` and forced for now. Eventually we will learn about `guard-let`.

### If-let

We can unwrap an optional value using `if-let` block. To unwrap `myInt` we can write:

```swift
var myInt:Int?
//assigning a value...
myInt = 10

//optional binding with if-let...
if let unwrappedMyInt = myInt{
    //value present
    print(unwrappedMyInt)
}else{
    // handling nil
    print("Optional value myInt must be initialized!")
}
```

It prints:

```
10
```

So here, we are binding the optional value by assigning it to `unwrappedMyInt` constant. If a value is present, the `unwrappedMyInt` will hold the unwrapped value from the optional `myInt`; else, we have to handle the condition where we have `nil` in our optional.

### Forced

Another way of unwrapping an optional is using forced unwrapping. We need to put a `!` after the optional variable to unwrap the value from it forcefully. For example, we can write:

```swift
//forced unwrapping...
print(myInt!)
// prints 10
```

Which will unwrap the value of `myInt` forcefully, even if it is `nil`. So you should refrain from using `!` unless you are absolutely sure that the value is not `nil`.

**The usage of optionals is very common in Swift, and eventually, we will have more examples down the road.**
