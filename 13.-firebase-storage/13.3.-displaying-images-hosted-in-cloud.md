# 13.3. Displaying Images Hosted in Cloud

Now, we know the download URL of the profile photo of the logged-in user. We will now display it in an ImageView.

We first add a custom utility for the UIImageView class using `extension` keyword. Let's create a file named 'ImageViewUtils.swift'.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-06-05 at 6.52.34 PM (1).png" alt="" width="345"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Put the following code there:

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```swift
//
//  ImageViewUtils.swift
//  App12
//
//  Created by Sakib Miazi on 6/5/23.
//

import Foundation
import UIKit

extension UIImageView {
    //MARK: Borrowed from: https://www.hackingwithswift.com/example-code/uikit/how-to-load-a-remote-image-url-into-uiimageview
    
    func loadRemoteImage(from url: URL) {
        DispatchQueue.global().async { [weak self] in
            if let data = try? Data(contentsOf: url) {
                if let image = UIImage(data: data) {
                    DispatchQueue.main.async {
                        self?.image = image
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
{% endcode %}

In the above code:

* We are extending the default UIImageView class and adding `loadRemoteImage(from url: URL)` method.
* On line 15: We are creating a background task to load the cloud image. It has to be through an asynchronous background thread because it is a network call. We cannot guarantee the image getting downloaded instantly.
* If the data from the remote URL is a valid image, then we load the data as image into the UIImageView.

Now, we need to open ViewController.swift file and scroll down to `handleAuth`.

Let's add the following couple of lines of code in the file:

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```swift
//
//  ViewController.swift
//  App12
//
//  Created by Sakib Miazi on 6/1/23.
//

//codes omitted...

class ViewController: UIViewController {

   //codes omitted...
    
    override func viewWillAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
        super.viewWillAppear(animated)
        
        //MARK: handling if the Authentication state is changed (sign in, sign out, register)...
        handleAuth = Auth.auth().addStateDidChangeListener{ auth, user in
            if user == nil{
               //codes omitted...
                
            }else{
                //codes omitted...
                
                //MARK: setting the profile photo...
                if let url = self.currentUser?.photoURL{
                    self.mainScreen.profilePic.loadRemoteImage(from: url)
                }
                
                //codes omitted...
                
            }
        }
    }
    
    //codes omitted...
}


```
{% endcode %}

In the above code:

* If the user is logged in on lines 26 through 28, we are checking whether the user's profile photo is nil. If it's not nil, we set the `profilePic`'s image using our custom utility.

Let's run the app now.

### Great!!! We now know how to store and retrieve an image using Firebase Storage.

### What data can you store in a FirebaseAuth user object?

* Firebase users have a fixed set of basic properties—a unique ID, a primary email address, a name and a photo URL—stored in the project's user database, that can be updated by the user (iOS, Android, web). **You cannot add other properties to the user object directly; instead, you can store the additional properties in any other storage services, like Google Cloud Firestore.**
