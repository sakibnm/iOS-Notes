# 10.6. Fetching Data with AlamoFire: GET

It's time to fetch the contacts' names and display them in our table view. We will call the API with `getall` endpoint when the app starts, and display the response on the table view ([10.3.-testing-our-simple-custom-api-with-postman.md](10.3.-testing-our-simple-custom-api-with-postman.md "mention")).

### Using Alamofire for text responses

If you noticed, in our API, we are getting back text responses from the server. We will use Alamofire to process the responses. Before we do, let's define an array of Strings in our ViewController for populating the table view. That array will hold the names of the contacts returned by the API endpoint `getall`.

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```swift
//
//  ViewController.swift
//  App10
//
//  Created by Sakib Miazi on 5/25/23.
//

import UIKit
import Alamofire

class ViewController: UIViewController {
    
    let mainScreen = MainScreenView()
    
    //MARK: list to display the contact names in the TableView...
    var contactNames = [String]()
    
    //codes omitted...
}

```
{% endcode %}

First, we need the API base URL to be set up. You can directly use the URL string in the call; however, it is always a better practice if you save these API details in a separate file as a static String, so that you can reuse that from any screen if you need to.

Let's create a file named `APIConfigs.swift` under `App10` folder. It is a Swift class file, **not a CocoaTouch Class.**

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-05-25 at 8.45.51 PM (1).png>)

In APIConfig.swift, let's add the static constant for the base URL:

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```swift
//
//  Configs.swift
//  App10
//
//  Created by Sakib Miazi on 5/25/23.
//

import Foundation

class APIConfigs{
    //MARK: API base URL...
    static let baseURL = "http://apis.sakibnm.space:8888/contacts/text/"
}
```
{% endcode %}

You can access the base URL by writing `APIConfigs.baseURL` from anywhere in the project.

### The 'getall' endpoint with Alamofire

Now, let's write a function to call the `getall` API endpoint and load the names in `contactNames` array.

<pre class="language-swift" data-line-numbers><code class="lang-swift">//
//  ViewController.swift
//  App10
//
//  Created by Sakib Miazi on 5/25/23.
//
import UIKit
import Alamofire

<strong>class ViewController: UIViewController {
</strong>    
    let mainScreen = MainScreenView()
    
    //MARK: list to display the contact names in the TableView...
    var contactNames = [String]()
    
    override func loadView() {
        view = mainScreen
    }
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        title = "Contacts API Testing"
        
        //get all contact names when the main screen loads...
        getAllContacts()
    }
    
    //MARK: get all contacts...
    func getAllContacts(){
        if let url = URL(string: APIConfigs.baseURL + "getall"){
            AF.request(url, method: .get)
                .responseString(completionHandler: { response in
                        print(response.result)
                    }
                )
        }
    }
}

</code></pre>

First of all, you need to **import the Alamofire library**.

Let's look at the function `getAllContacs()` method definition:

* First, we build the URL with the `baseURL` and the `getall` endpoint using URL() initializer. URL() returns a URL wrapped with optional (in case it cannot create a valid URL, it returns an Optional(nil)). We have to unwrap it. So we unwrap it and put it in the constant `url`.
* Then we use `url` to make a request with Alamofire. We use `AF` to use Alamofire functions. So, here we are creating an Alamofire request with the `url` we built.
* If you noticed, we set the method of the request to `.get`. Remember, `getall` endpoint of the API server expects a GET request.
* Then we call the `responseString()` method for the request. We are handling text responses, right? So, we need to catch String-type data from the response we get from the server.
* Then we write a closure `completionHandler` to deal with the data after we receive the response.\
  \
  _<mark style="color:orange;">**Please note any communication over the Internet is Asynchronous. That means we are dealing with data that are hosted probably hundreds if not thousands of miles away. So, it will take time to receive the response from the server after you send the request. It might feel like it's real-time, but logically, it's not. So, when we build apps that communicate over the Internet, we must be very careful dealing with it. We should not expect that we will receive the response right away.**</mark>_&#x20;
* In the closure, we print `response.result` to see what kind of data we received as the response. If you run the app now, It prints something like this:\
  **`success("Alice Smith\nBob Smith\nDavid B\nAlex C\nMark W\n")`**
  * `success()` in the response means the request was successfully transmitted, and there was no network error.
  * See, we have  in between two consecutive names. The character  means a new line. So, we have to fetch the whole String and then use it.
* **Also, the status code the response has is very important. We need to check if it is a 200-level or a 400-level code.**
  * <mark style="color:green;">**200-level codes mean the request was valid, and we received a desirable response.**</mark>
  * <mark style="color:red;">**400-level codes mean the request was incorrect, so we must handle the response appropriately to manage the UI elements properly.**</mark>

So, let's write the following code in the `completionHandler` closure taking care of the status codes and network errors:

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```swift
//MARK: get all contacts...
func getAllContacts(){
    if let url = URL(string: APIConfigs.baseURL + "getall"){
        AF.request(url, method: .get).responseString(completionHandler: { response in
            //MARK: retrieving the status code...
            let status = response.response?.statusCode
            
            switch response.result{
            case .success(let data):
                //MARK: there was no network error...
                
                //status code is Optional, so unwrapping it...
                if let uwStatusCode = status{
                    switch uwStatusCode{
                        case 200...299:
                        //MARK: the request was valid 200-level...
                            var names = data.components(separatedBy: "\n")
                            self.contactNames = names
                            print(self.contactNames)
                            break
                
                        case 400...499:
                        //MARK: the request was not valid 400-level...
                            print(data)
                            break
                
                        default:
                        //MARK: probably a 500-level error...
                            print(data)
                            break
                
                    }
                }
                break
                
            case .failure(let error):
                //MARK: there was a network error...
                print(error)
                break
            }
        })
    }
}
```
{% endcode %}

In the above code:

* First, we retrieve the status code from the response (at line 6). It is an optional value. So, we need to unwrap it when we use it.
* Then we check for network errors from `response.result`. (At line 8).
  * If there is no network error, we now check if the status code is a 200-level- or 400-level.
  * If the code is a 200-level code:
    * Then we separate each line by splitting the data using the delimiter . (At line 17).
    * Then we set the Strings from data to `contactNames` array.
    * And then, we print the array.
  * If the code is 400- or 500-level, we print the debug log for now. You might want to handle these conditions depending on the app's needs.
* We might need to check our internet connection if there is a network failure. (at line 36).

**Now, if we run the app, it will run, but you won't see any items printed.** If you check the outputs, you will see something like the following:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
sessionTaskFailed(error: Error Domain=NSURLErrorDomain Code=-1022 "The resource could not be loaded because the App Transport Security policy requires the use of a secure connection." 
```
{% endcode %}

<mark style="color:red;">**By default, iOS does not allow HTTP connections without encryption. We should always use the connections through HTTPS.**</mark>

**However,** since my API is a dumb API, and I am using the API for demonstration purposes, I didn't go through the HTTPS configuration process. So, we need to enable unencrypted HTTP connections in our app.

### Enabling unencrypted HTTP in our app

* We need to open `Info.plist` file from the File Navigator of the project.
* Right-click (control + click) on the empty space of `Info.plist`.
* Select `Add Row`.
* Search and Select "App Transport Security Settings."
  * Inside "App Transport Security Settings," add an attribute by clicking plus icon(`+`).
  * Set "Allow Arbitrary Loads" attribute's value to YES.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/10.12 (1).gif" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

It should now allow unencrypted HTTP.

If we run the app now, it should print the following:

**`["Alice Smith", "Bob Smith", "David B", "Alex C", "Mark W", ""]`.**

**Interestingly, there is an empty String at the end.** This happens because the server adds a  character at the end of the last user's name. So we need to remove it from the `contactNames`.

Let's add `self.contactNames.removeLast()` after line 18.

Now, we have the perfect `contactNames` array to be displayed in the table view.

### Patching data with the table view

Now, let's adopt the protocols for the table view:

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```swift
extension ViewController: UITableViewDelegate, UITableViewDataSource{
    func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, numberOfRowsInSection section: Int) -> Int {
        return contactNames.count
    }
    
    func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UITableViewCell {
        let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: "names", for: indexPath) as! ContactsTableViewCell
        cell.labelName.text = contactNames[indexPath.row]
        return cell
    }
    
    func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, didSelectRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) {
        
    }
}
```
{% endcode %}

Then, set the delegate and data source in `viewDidLoad()` method.

<pre class="language-swift" data-line-numbers><code class="lang-swift">override func viewDidLoad() {
     super.viewDidLoad()
     
     title = "Contacts API Testing"
     
     //MARK: setting the delegate and data source...
     mainScreen.tableViewContacts.dataSource = self
     mainScreen.tableViewContacts.delegate = self
<strong>     
</strong><strong>     //MARK: removing the separator line...
</strong>     mainScreen.tableViewContacts.separatorStyle = .none
     
     //get all contact names when the main screen loads...
     getAllContacts()
}
</code></pre>

In the above code, at line 11, we remove the separator line of the table view. If you want to remove the line, you get to do this after the table view is populated. If you add this instruction when setting up the table view, it will not work. So, we write this code in the controller.

If you run the app now, the table view remains empty. As I discussed before, the internet calls are asynchronous. So, we need to wait until the response is received. Once we receive the response, we should reload the data for the table view. Hence, we add the following line into `getAllContacts()` method after we remove the last element from `contactNames`: `self.mainScreen.tableViewContacts.reloadData()`.

The final `getAllContacts()` method looks as follows:

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```swift
//MARK: get all contacts...
func getAllContacts(){
    if let url = URL(string: APIConfigs.baseURL + "getall"){
        AF.request(url, method: .get).responseString(completionHandler: { response in
            //MARK: retrieving the status code...
            let status = response.response?.statusCode
            
            switch response.result{
            case .success(let data):
                //MARK: there was no network error...
                
                //MARK: status code is Optional, so unwrapping it...
                if let uwStatusCode = status{
                    switch uwStatusCode{
                        case 200...299:
                        //MARK: the request was valid 200-level...
                            var names = data.components(separatedBy: "\n")
                            self.contactNames = names
                            self.contactNames.removeLast()
                            self.mainScreen.tableViewContacts.reloadData()
                            print(self.contactNames)
                            break
                
                        case 400...499:
                        //MARK: the request was not valid 400-level...
                            print(data)
                            break
                
                        default:
                        //MARK: probably a 500-level error...
                            print(data)
                            break
                
                    }
                }
                break
                
            case .failure(let error):
                //MARK: there was a network error...
                print(error)
                break
            }
        })
    }
}
```
{% endcode %}

Let's run the app again. It should look like this:
