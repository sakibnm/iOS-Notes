# 2.2. Sets

A Set in Swift is a similar data structure to an Array with two differences:

* No item in a set can appear twice. Each item must be unique in a set.
* A set is not ordered like an array, so we cannot access the items in a set using indices. The items are stored in random positions.

To create a set, we use the following literal:`Set<DataType>`. For example, the following code creates a new empty set of strings `colors`:

<pre class="language-swift"><code class="lang-swift"><strong>// Creating an empty set of strings...
</strong><strong>var colors = Set&#x3C;String>()
</strong></code></pre>

You can add a new item in a set using `insert()` function, like:

```swift
colors.insert("black")
// prints the current Set...
print(colors)
```

The print function prints:

```
["black"]
```

Let's add a couple more colors:

```swift
colors.insert("blue")
colors.insert("black")

// prints the current Set...
print(colors)
```

Now, if it were an array, the corresponding array would be `["black", "blue", "black"]`. However, the above code outputs:

```
["blue", "black"]
```

So, we can see that the set `colors` is not adding `black` again. It is holding one `black` and one `blue`. So, it holds unique elements. Also, the order of the set is not fixed since `blue` was added after `black`, but it displays it in the opposite order here.

Now, if you are working with a set where you will not change the elements in the future you should use `let` to create a set with predefined values.

For example,

```swift
let colors = Set(["blue", "black", "red"])
```

Note: you can remove an element from a set by calling `remove()` function. Try it yourself!
