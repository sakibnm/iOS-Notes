# 2. Collections

So far, we have discussed a few simple Data types like String, Int, Double, etc. **Now, we will move into learning a few useful Collections like Arrays, Sets, Tuples, and Dictionaries.**

We often work with a list of data in real life, meaning a list of items having similar properties; for example, we might need to display a list of similar hotels near a specific location. We use Collections like Arrays, Sets, Dictionaries, etc., to store a list or group of data items together. Collections are powerful tools to store, manage and order data while running the program.
