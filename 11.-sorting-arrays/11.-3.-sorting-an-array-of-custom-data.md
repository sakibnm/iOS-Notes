# 11. 3. Sorting an array of custom data

Let's look at the following example:

```swift
import UIKit

struct User{
    var name: String
    var age: Int
    var city: String
}

var users = [
    User(name: "Alice", age: 12, city: "Boston"),
    User(name: "Bob", age: 21, city: "Charlotte"),
    User(name: "Chris", age: 45, city: "NYC"),
    User(name: "David", age: 23, city: "Boston"),
    User(name: "Dillon", age: 89, city: "San Francisco"),
]

//MARK: sort by name in decreasing order
users.sort(by: { (user1:User, user2:User)-> Bool in
    return user1.name > user2.name
})

for user in users{
    print(user)
}
/*prints:
User(name: "Dillon", age: 89, city: "San Francisco")
User(name: "David", age: 23, city: "Boston")
User(name: "Chris", age: 45, city: "NYC")
User(name: "Bob", age: 21, city: "Charlotte")
User(name: "Alice", age: 12, city: "Boston")
 */

//MARK: sort by age in increasing order
users.sort(by: { (user1:User, user2:User)-> Bool in
    return user1.age < user2.age
})

for user in users{
    print(user)
}
/* prints:
User(name: "Alice", age: 12, city: "Boston")
User(name: "Bob", age: 21, city: "Charlotte")
User(name: "David", age: 23, city: "Boston")
User(name: "Chris", age: 45, city: "NYC")
User(name: "Dillon", age: 89, city: "San Francisco")
*/

```

This example is pretty self-explanatory. We have a struct to create our custom data type, `User`. Each user has `name`, `age`, and `city`.

We first want to sort the array of `User`s based on their name in decreasing order. So, wrote a closure that takes in a pair of `User` objects. Then compared their names.

The next task is to sort the users in increasing order of their age. The next closure takes care of it.

**That's pretty much it about the basics of sorting in Swift.**
