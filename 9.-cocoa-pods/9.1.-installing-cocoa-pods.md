### **There are two ways of installing CocoaPods on your Mac:**

#### 1. Using the command in cocoapods.org:

* Copy the command (`sudo gem install cocoapods`) from the CocoaPods webpage and paste it into the Terminal. Put in your password and press return. It should install CocoaPods. After installation is done, put the command `pod --version` into your terminal. It should show something like: `1.12.1`. If you see that, you are done installing CocoaPods on your Mac.

#### **2. If the above method doesn't work and your Terminal is not responding, try the following (more stable) method:**

* **Install Homebrew on your Mac:** **Homebrew** is an alternative (Linux-like) package manager for Mac. It is very widely used and quite useful to install open-sourced software packages.
  * Visit: [https://github.com/Homebrew/install](https://github.com/Homebrew/install)
  * Copy the terminal command posted there: `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`.
  * Paste it into your Terminal.
  * Press the return key.
  * Put in your Mac password.
  * It should install **homebrew** on your Mac.
* **Install CocoaPods using Homebrew:**
  * Open your Terminal and put the following command there:
    * `brew install cocoapods`
  * Press the return key.
  * It should be installing **CocoaPods** on your Mac.
  * After it's done, put the following command `pod --version` into your terminal. It should show something like the following: `1.12.1`. If you see that, you are done installing CocoaPods on your Mac.
