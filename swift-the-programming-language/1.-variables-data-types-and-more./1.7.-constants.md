# 1.7. Constants

So far, we talked about variables. Just as a refresher, you can always change the values of a variable, maintaining the **type-safety**. However, in many cases, you would not want a value to be changeable and keep it unchanged while the program runs. These are called **constants.**

To write a constant in Swift, you need to use the keyword `let`. You write, `let` `variableName` : `DataType` = `value`. (Recall Type annotations?)

For example, let's add the following line of code in our Playground:

```swift
let myConstant:Int = 14
print("My constant is \(myConstant)")
```

It will output the following:

```
My constant is 14
```

Now, let's try to set a new value `20` to `myConstant`.

```swift
myConstant = 20
```

But now you will see the following error:

**So, `myConstant` is not changeable (not mutable).**

\*\*Please note: when you will be building iOS apps, \*\*<mark style="color:red;">**use constants as much as possible.**</mark> It is suggested that you should declare everything as constants using `let` and then selectively change them to variables when needed.
