# 1.3. Type safety

Swift is a type-safe language. It means that once you create a variable, it is stuck with a specific data type, and you cannot change the data type of it. Every variable has to have a particular data type.

So far in our code, we have a variable _**greeting**_ having the value "Hello, Bonobos!!!". What if we try to set the value of _**greeting**_ to 12? Let's try it!

```swift
greeting = 12
```

And click on play! We will see something like the following:

It says, "Cannot assign the value of type **'Int'** to **'String'**. So it means that Swift automatically sets the type of the variable _**greeting**_ to a String when it creates the variable with a String. Now that the type is already assigned, when I wanted to change the value to an integer 12, it yelled at me.

Ok, let's create another variable to hold the integer.

```swift
var count = 12
```

Here it creates a variable named count, then finds that the value I am initially setting (12) is of type **Int** (integer). So, _**count**_ can only hold **Int**s after the creation.

There is a _swift_ and usable trick for large integers. For example, if you want to store 1 million (1000000) in a variable, It is hard to read/type when you deal with a stream of consecutive zeroes together. Swift uses underscores as thousand separators. Like this:

```swift
var million = 1_000_000
```

**To sum up, you need to be very careful about the data types of variables. You must not mix up data types for a particular variable.**
