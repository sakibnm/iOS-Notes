# 1.5. Floating point numbers and Type annotation

Two basic data types in Swift handle the floating point numbers (fractional values): **Double** and **Float.**

**Double** is short for "double-precision floating point number." It is a 64-bit floating point number. Long story short, it can hold very large fractional values. Swift uses **Double** as its default data type for floating point literals.

On the other hand, **Float** is a 32-bit floating point number, which is less precise than **Double,** and you do not need to use it unless you are building games or graphics applications.

So now, let's write a Double variable:

```swift
var myNum = 12.5
print(myNum)
print(type(of: myNum))
```

Here Swift automatically sets the type of the variable myNum to **Double** since I put a fractional value to it. The above code outputs the following:

The first print() outputs the value of _**myNum**_, and the second print outputs the type of the variable _**myNum**_.

Now, if you need to define a **Float** at some point\*\*,\*\* how would you do it? Remember, Swift, by default, uses **Double** for fractional values. That's where we will learn how to create a variable with a predefined type. For example, in the following code, I am creating a **Float** variable:

```swift
var myFloat:Float = 13
print(myFloat)
print(type(of: myFloat))
```

Here, I am writing 'var' to say the next one is a variable, as earlier. I give the variable a name, 'myFloat', and then I put a colon(:), **followed by the type of the variable (Float),** and finally, I assign a value, 13. This is a standard way of defining a variable in Swift. We will eventually learn about a more concrete way of declaring and defining the variables. Now the output of the code is:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-05-01 at 3.34.11 PM (3).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

One thing to note is that I put the value as 13 for myFloat, which would be interpreted as an Int if I did not specifically predefine it as a **Float.** If you look at the output, 13 became 13.0, which is a fractional number.
