# 1.6. More print, String interpolation

Swift allows you to insert values of variables into a String. String interpolation is useful for creating dynamic texts (labels, error messages, debug information, etc.) and formatting texts.

In Swift, String interpolation is done using `\(...)` notation. Let's look into an example. So far, what we have in our playground are a few variables, such as `myNum`, `myFloat`, and `multiline`. (`myNum` is a Double, `myFloat` is a Float, and `multiline` is a string.)

So let's add the following lines of code to your Playground:

```swift
var myString = 
    "My Double number is \(myNum). My Float number is \(myFloat). And, my multiline string is \(multiline)"
print(myString)
```

If you run the code, the output would be:

```
My Double number is 12.5. My Float number is 13.0. And, my multiline string is I am a multiline String.
I might look weird, but I am really very simple.
At times I could be very useful!
```

**Here, You can see that `myNum`(a Double), `myFloat` (a Float), and `multiline` (even a String) have been interpolated into `myString`.**

Now, If we change the code to the following:

```swift
var myString = """
My Double number is \(myNum).
My Float number is \(myFloat).
And, my multiline string is
\(multiline)
"""

print(myString)
```

The output becomes:

```
My Double number is 12.5.
My Float number is 13.0.
And, my multiline string is
I am a multiline String.
I might look weird, but I am really very simple.
At times I could be very useful!
```

Here we see how multiline Strings and String interpolation can be used together to format the texts.

**Question:**

* _Can you print the same output by calling the `print()` function without creating the `myString` variable?_
