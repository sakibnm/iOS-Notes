# 1.1. Creating a Swift Playground

Open Xcode from your Launchpad. You should be seeing something like the following:

Do not create an Xcode project yet; click on _**File -> New -> Playground**_. Select _**Blank**,_ click _**Next**_, give the playground a name, and click on _Create._ If you see something like the following, you are good to go! That is the first step toward learning Swift!!!
