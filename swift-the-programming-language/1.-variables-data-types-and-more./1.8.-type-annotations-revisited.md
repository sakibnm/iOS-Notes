# 1.8. Type annotations (revisited)

As we have already discussed a couple of times, we can predefine the data type for a variable when you are creating it. This is called **Type annotations.**

The general format of type annotations is as follows: `let` `variableName` : `DataType` = `value`.

A few examples could be:

```swift
let myName:String = "Sakib Miazi"
var myAge:Int = 10
let iUseIPhone:Bool = false
```
