# 1.4. Strings and print to console

Swift allows you to write strings in two ways. The first one is, of course, the age-old String we declare inside **" "**. The next one is multiline strings which you can write inside **""" """** (triple quotes on both sides).

An example of the first type is the _**greeting**_ variable we have. Let's try to see what a multi-line string is.

Let's create a string like the following:

```swift
var multiline = """
I am a multiline String.
I might look weird, but I am really very simple.
At times I could be very useful!
"""
```

After you define the String, if you look at the output area, you'll see that a character **'\n' is** added between two lines. **'\n'** denotes a new line. It means that the variable multiline contains a String that will be logically multiline and follows the exact format the user put in.

Now, you can use the command **print()** to display the output to the console. Let's put the following line of code:

```swift
print(multiline)
```

It should display the following at the bottom (console output) of Xcode:

Now you get the full view of how a multiline String would get displayed.
