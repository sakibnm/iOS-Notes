# 11.4. 'Must Do's While Decoding JSON adopting Codable

Let's look into the example JSON response for the `details` endpoint again:

```json
{
    "email": "alice@email.comt",
    "name": "Alice Smith",
    "phone": 6781234567
}
```

And the data model for the above JSON that adopts the Codable protocol is:

```swift
struct Contact: Codable{
    var name:String
    var email:String
    var phone:Int
}
```

So let's compare the two and think about what are the things we need to handle to parse data carefully from JSON response by adopting Codable:

* The names of the keys (e.g., "email") must match the names of the variables in the Codable struct (e.g., name).
* The types of the values in the response JSON must match the types of the variables in the Codable struct. For example, `"phone": 6781234567` means the value for the key "phone" has a value of integer data type. So we must set the type of the variable `phone` in struct `Contact` to `Int`.
* You do not have to define variables for all the keys in JSON. You can selectively write variables to parse the needed data from a big JSON object.

<mark style="color:red;">**So, the name and the data type of the variables in a Codable must match the name of the keys and the type of the values in JSON. Otherwise, JSON decoding will not work.**</mark>
