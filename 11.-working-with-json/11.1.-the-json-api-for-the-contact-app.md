# 11.1. The JSON API for the Contact App

## The API details:

The setup of the JSON API is exactly the same as the text API we used in App9. Just change the base URL. It'll work just fine.

### The base URL:

https://apis.sakibnm.work:8888/contacts/json/

**The endpoints:**

* Get all contacts: `getall`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Query Params: none
* Get the details of a particular contact: `details`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Query Params: `name`
* Add a contact: `add`
  * Method: `POST`
  * Body Params: `name`, `email`, `phone`.
* Delete a particular contact: `delete`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Query Params: `name`

The only difference is that the response we will get from the API server is not plain String. They are JSON-formatted Strings.

For example,

### **getall:**

https://apis.sakibnm.work:8888/contacts/json/getall

* The response you should get is similar to the following:

```json
    {
        "contacts": [
            {
                "name": "Alice Smith"
            },
            {
                "name": "Bob Smith"
            },
            {
                "name": "David B"
            },
            {
                "name": "Alex C"
            },
            {
                "name": "Mark W"
            },
            {
                "name": "Bob P"
            },
            {
                "name": "Adam F"
            }
        ]
    }
```

### **details:**

https://apis.sakibnm.work:8888/contacts/json/details?name=Alice Smith

* The response should be:

```json
    {
        "email": "asmith@gmail.com",
        "name": "Alice Smith",
        "phone": 9801234567
    }
```

* If the contact is not found, the response should be:

```json
    {
        "error": "Error: Contact Alice Smith not found!"
    }
```

### **delete:**

https://apis.sakibnm.work:8888/contacts/json/delete?name=Alice Smith

* The response should be:

```json
    {
        "info": "Contact Alice Smith is deleted!"
    }
```

* If the contact is not found, the response should be:

```json
    {
        "error": "Error: Contact not found!"
    }
```

### **add:**

https://apis.sakibnm.work:8888/contacts/json/add \[with POST body form]

* If successful, you should receive something like the following:

```json
    {
        "info": "Contact created: Alice Smith, david@email.comt, 6781234567"
    }
```

* If the contact is already there:

```json
    {
        "error": "Error: Contact Alice Smith already exists!"
    }
```
