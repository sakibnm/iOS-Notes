# 5.1. Expense App

So, let's create an app called 'App5'. Our preliminary target is to build something like the following app:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-05-18 at 10.45.04 AM (1).png>) ![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-05-18 at 10.45.19 AM (1).png>)

The first screen contains a list of expenses. The user can add a new expense by tapping on the plus icon (`+`) on the navigation bar. If a user taps on `+` icon, it takes them to the next screen where they can put the details of the expense.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-05-18 at 10.56.57 AM.png>) ![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-05-18 at 10.45.48 AM (1).png>)

Once the user puts in the details and taps the Add Expense button, it should return to the first screen and show the newly added expense.

Now let's build the app.
