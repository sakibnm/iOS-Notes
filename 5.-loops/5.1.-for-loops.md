# 5.1. For loops

For loops are the most common loops in Swift, and you'll probably use this loop for more than 90% of cases. We use `for` loops to iterate over a sequence of values or a range of values.

For example, the following code prints the integers in the range `1...10`.

```swift
let range = 1...10

for number in range{
    print(number)
}
```

Another example could be iterating through an array and printing the elements:

```swift
var carMakesSecond = ["Toyota", "Honda", "Mazda", "Chevy"]

for item in carMakesSecond{
    print(item)
}
```

In Swift, we have an extra feature. If we have a situation where we are not using the variable a for loop gives us (`number` or `item` in the above examples), we can skip creating the unnecessary values. For example, if we want to do the same task 10 times, we can write the following code:

```swift
for _ in 1...10{
    print("Doing the task!")
}
```

Here, underscore skips create unnecessary values.
