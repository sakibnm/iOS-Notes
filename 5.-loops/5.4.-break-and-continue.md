# 5.4. Break and continue

### Breaking/exiting loops

Sometimes we want to stop repeating the code block in a loop. We use the keyword `break` to do that. Let's look into the example below:

```swift
let breakPoint = 4
var countDown = 1
while breakPoint >= 0 {
    print("I will run!")
    
//  activating break point
    if countDown == breakPoint{
        print("I am tired now!")
        break
    }
    countDown += 1
}
```

Here the while loop is running infinitely if the value of `breakPoint` is greater than or equal to `0`. So, we need to break it when the `countDown` reaches the `breakPoint`. Thats where we user the keyword `break`.

### Skipping a block manually

Sometimes, we want to skip executing a repeated block for an iteration. Swift uses the keyword `continue` to do that. Let's look into the following example:

```swift
for number in 1...10 {
    //skipping the even numbers
    if number%2 == 0{
        continue
    }
    
    print("This an odd number:\(number)")
}
```

Here, we wanted to print the odd integers between 1 and 10. So, we are running a for loop from 1 to 10 and skipping the even numbers.
