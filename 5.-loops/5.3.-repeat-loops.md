# 5.3. Repeat loops

The third way of writing loops is `repeat` loops. It is identical to a while loop, but the condition is checked at the end of the code block. If we use the same example from before, we can write:

```swift
var myNum = 1

repeat{
    //code block
    print(myNum)
    myNum += 1
} while myNum <= 50

```

The point is `repeat` loops will execute the code block at least once. So, you should be careful about the cases where the first iteration may result in errors.
