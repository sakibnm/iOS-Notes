# 5.2. While loops

The second most common loops in Swift are `while` loops. We use a while loop to run a code block repeatedly as long as a given condition is true. A general structure of a `while` loop is:

```swift
while condition {
    //code block
}
```

For example, the following code prints all the integers below 50:

```swift
var targetNum = 1
while targetNum <= 50{
    //code block
    print(targetNum)
    targetNum += 1
}
```

Here the condition is: if `targetNum` is less than or equal to 50.
