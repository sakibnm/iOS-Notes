# 5. Loops

If you know any programming language, you probably have heard the word `loop` most frequently. Yes, Swift, too, has loops. Basically, the structure of a loop is simple, run a block of code repeatedly while a condition is true or until the condition is false.

There are three kinds of loops in Swift:

* For loops
* While loops
* Repeat-while loops
