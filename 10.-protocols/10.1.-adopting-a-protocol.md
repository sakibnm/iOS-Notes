# 10.1. Adopting a protocol

A protocol contains only the declarations of the properties and functions that are needed to be adopted and implemented by a struct or class. For example, let's define our own USB interface, `USBMad.`

We can define our own `USBMad` protocol with a few guidelines:

* We need an id of the device to implement this protocol.
* We have the option to support a display adapter through that port.
* We have the option to support audio through that interface.
* We must implement charging through the port.
* We must implement data transfer through the port.

So we define the protocol where we declare three variables, `id` - for the device ID, `supportsDisplayAdapter` - to decide whether we would implement the display feature, and `supportsAudio` - to decide whether we would implement the audio or not. We also declare two methods to say this `USBMad` protocol must provide functionalities to charge the accessories and transfer data.

```swift
protocol USBMad{
    var id:Int{get}
    var supportsDisplayAdapter:Bool{get}
    var supportsAudio:Bool{get}
    func chargeAccessories()
    func transferData()
}
```

_<mark style="color:orange;">You might be confused about</mark>_ _<mark style="color:orange;">`{get}`</mark>_ _<mark style="color:orange;">declarations you see in the code. It means the property is a gettable property when implemented. You can also declare a property both gettable and settable by declaring</mark>_ _<mark style="color:orange;">`{get set}`</mark><mark style="color:orange;">. I will not dig deeper into these declarations; for now, I will just use</mark>_ _<mark style="color:orange;">`{get}`</mark><mark style="color:orange;">. For more information,</mark>_ [_you can read this article_](https://chetan-aggarwal.medium.com/swift-protocols-properties-distinction-get-get-set-32a34a7f16e9)_._

Now, let's adopt our USBMad protocol in our `MyLaptop` struct:

```swift
struct MyLaptop: USBMad{
    //struct's own properties
    var name:String
    var architecture:String
    
    //adopted/conformed variables and methods
    var id: Int
    var supportsDisplayAdapter: Bool
    var supportsAudio: Bool
    
    //adopted and to be implemented methods
    func chargeAccessories() {
        //MyLaptop's implementation of adopted method
        print("I am able to charge the accessories!")
    }
    func transferData() {
        //MyLaptop's implementation of adopted method
        print("You can send/receive data to/from me!")
    }   
}
```

Here, we are defining our struct `MyLaptop` where we adopt the `USBMad` protocol. We wrote `MyLaptop : USBMad` to say that `MyLaptop` adopts `USBMad` protocol. `MyLaptop` has it's own variables, `name` and `architecture`. Also, since it adopts the `USBMad` protocol, it must adopt the properties and methods of `USBMad` and implement them.

So we can create an instance of `MyLaptop` like the following:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```swift
let myLaptop = MyLaptop(
    name: "Sakib's Macbook",
    architecture: "ARM64",
    id: 1,
    supportsDisplayAdapter: true,
    supportsAudio: true
)

myLaptop.chargeAccessories()
//prints: I am able to charge the accessories!

myLaptop.transferData()
//prints: You can send/receive data to/from me!
```
{% endcode %}

See, we not only have to initialize `MyLaptop`'s own properties but must also initialize the properties `MyLaptop` adopts from `USBMad`.

Let's add another method `describe()` to `MyLaptop`:

```swift
struct MyLaptop: USBMad{
    //struct's own properties
    var name:String
    var architecture:String
    
    //adopted/conformed variables and methods
    var id: Int
    var supportsDisplayAdapter: Bool
    var supportsAudio: Bool
    
    //adopted and to be implemented methods
    func chargeAccessories() {
        //MyLaptop's implementation of adopted method
        print("I am able to charge the accessories!")
    }
    func transferData() {
        //MyLaptop's implementation of adopted method
        print("You can send/receive data to/from me!")
    }
    
    //MyLaptop's own method...
    func describe(){
        print(
            """
            My name is \(name).
            I use \(architecture) architecture.
            I have a USBMad interface with id: \(id).
            """
        )
        self.chargeAccessories()
        self.transferData()
    }
}
```

Calling `myLaptop.describe()` prints:

```
My name is Sakib's Macbook.
I use ARM64 architecture.
I have a USBMad interface with id: 1.
I am able to charge the accessories!
You can send/receive data to/from me!
```

These are the CliffsNotes version of adopting/confirming a protocol. You will see extensive use of protocols in iOS development.
