# 10.3. Inheriting a super class and adopting protocols together

We are continuing with the previous example. Now let's expand on the idea. TAs are also students. A student can be either a graduate student or an undergrad student. Let's assume Alice is an undergrad TA. Let's see how we can write some code to define Alice:

First, we need to define a class `Student` that has property `name` and an initializer method to initialize the instance.

```swift
//super class Student...
class Student{
    var name: String
    init(name:String) {
        self.name = name
    }
}
```

Then we need to define the class `UndergradTA` that inherits `Student` class, and adopts or conforms `TeachingAssistant` protocol:

```swift
//UndergradTA inherits Student, and adopts/conforms TeachingAssistant protocol...

class UndergradTA: Student, TeachingAssistant{
    //own property course...
    var course:String
    
    //initializer for UndergradTA...
    init(name: String, course:String) {
        self.course = course
        super.init(name: name)
    }
    
    //defining adopted methods from TeachingAssistant...
    func biweeklyPayment() -> Double {
        return 1_500.00
    }
    
    func completeTraining() {
        print("\(name) completed the TA training.")
    }
    
    func rate() -> Int {
        return 5
    }
    
    // own describe method of UndergradTA...
    func describe(){
        print(
            """
            \(name) is a TA of \(course) course.
            They were rated \(self.rate())/5 by the professor.
            They are paid \(self.biweeklyPayment()) biweekly.
            """
        )
        self.completeTraining()
    }
}

```

<mark style="color:orange;">**Please note: a class can only inherit one superclass, but it can adopt as many protocols as it needs. So if there is a superclass to be inherited, the class is written as the first one after**</mark><mark style="color:orange;">\*\*</mark> `:` <mark style="color:orange;">**(like**</mark> <mark style="color:orange;">**`Student`**</mark> <mark style="color:orange;">**in this example)**</mark> <mark style="color:orange;">**followed by the protocols separated by**</mark> `,`(comma).\*\*

Here, in the above code, we can see `UndergradTA` the inherited `Student` class and adopted `TeachingAssistant` protocol. We have a new variable `course` in `UndergradTA`, so we write an `init()` method to initialize both the variable `course` and the variable `name` in the superclass `Student`.

Then we implement the adopted methods of the protocol `TeachingAssistant`. And finally we write `UndergradTA`'s own method `describe()`.

Let's create the TA `alice`:

```swift
let alice = UndergradTA(
    name: "Alice",
    course: "Mobile App Development"
)

alice.describe()

/*
 alice.describe() prints:
 Alice is a TA of Mobile App Development course.
 They were rated 5/5 by the professor.
 They are paid 1500.0 biweekly.
 Alice completed the TA training.
 */
```

**Please try the whole thing in your own playground.**

So now we have a basic understanding of how classes work with other classes and protocols. In iOS development, we will repeatedly face these concepts.
