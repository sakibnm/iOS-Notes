# 3.1. Arithmetic Operations

Let's do some arithmetic operations using Swift now. For addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, we use `+`,`-`,`*`, and `/` respectively. Let's look at the following code:

```swift
let num1 = 5
let num2 = 33

//Addition...
let sum = num1 + num2

//Subtraction...
let difference = num2 - num1

//Multiplication...
let product = num1 * num2

//Division (and remainder)...
let divided = num2 / num1
let remainder = num2 % num1

print(
    """
    Results:
    Sum = \(sum)
    Difference = \(difference)
    Product = \(product)
    Division result = \(divided)
    Division remainder = \(remainder)
    """
)
```

It prints:

```
Results:
Sum = 38
Difference = 28
Product = 165
Division result = 6
Division remainder = 3
```

From the above example, it feels very intuitive how you can directly use the operators `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` do the arithmetic operations. The remainder of a divide operation can be done with the dedicated operator `%`.

However, there are a few caveats to these operations. Let's look into the following code:

```swift
let myInt:Int = 20
let myDouble:Double = 30.5

let sum:Int = myInt + myDouble
```

_What do you think will happen?_

It should show something like the following:

Remember, `Double` is a 64-bits long number and `Int` is a 32-bits long number? We are trying to add an `Int`(`myInt`) and a `Double`(`myDouble`) together and put the result into an `Int`(`sum`). First of all, if you add an `Int` and a `Double` together, it results in a `Double` value, since `Double` has the largest capacity of the two. Now, we are trying to put that `Double` value into the constant `sum`, which is and `Int`. An `Int` doesn't have the capacity to hold a `Double`. So, it is yelling at us :man\_facepalming:

You should always be careful of the types of data before you use arithmetic operators in Swift. More on this later.
