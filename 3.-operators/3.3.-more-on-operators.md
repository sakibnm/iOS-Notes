# 3.3. More on Operators

In Swift, you can take a few shortcuts when you are using operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`). For example,

```swift
var budget = 30_000
let expense = 5_000
```

In the above code, we want to deduct the `expense` from our `budget`. To update our remaining budget we would usually do:

```swift
budget = budget - expense
```

We can take a shortcut here. instead of writing the above code, we can write:

```
// Instead of budget = budget - expense 
budget -= expense
```

Other examples could be:

```swift
//Increment...
var count = 0
count += 1 
// count = 1

//Multiply...
var number = 5
number *= 4 
// number = 20

//Divide...
var number2 = 10
number2 /= 2 
// number2 = 5

//String operations (concatenation)...
var name = "Mark"
var surname = "Webber"
name += surname 
// name = "MarkWebber"
```
