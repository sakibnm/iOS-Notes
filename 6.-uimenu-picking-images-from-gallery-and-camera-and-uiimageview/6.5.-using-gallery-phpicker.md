# 6.5. Using Gallery: PHPicker

[PHPicker](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/photokit/phpickerviewcontroller) _is a view controller that provides the user interface for choosing assets from the photo library._ We use this view controller to browse the local image assets, select the chosen image(s), and retrieve the image(s). It is a highly configurable and scalable tool and fairly easy to use. We need to import `PhotosUI` library to use the tool.

So, let's open AddExpenseViewController.swift file. We will write codes in `pickPhotoFromGallery()` method. We also need to adopt `PHPickerViewControllerDelegate` protocol using the `extension` keyword. Let's add the following code in AddExpenseViewController.swift file:

        let photoPicker = PHPickerViewController(configuration: configuration)
        
        photoPicker.delegate = self

    func picker(_ picker: PHPickerViewController, didFinishPicking results: [PHPickerResult]) {

        print(results)
        
        let itemprovider = results.map(\.itemProvider)
        
        for item in itemprovider{
            if item.canLoadObject(ofClass: UIImage.self){
                item.loadObject(ofClass: UIImage.self, completionHandler: { (image, error) in
                    DispatchQueue.main.async{
                        if let uwImage = image as? UIImage{
                            self.addExpenseScreen.buttonTakePhoto.setImage(
                                uwImage.withRenderingMode(.alwaysOriginal),
                                for: .normal
                            )
                            self.pickedImage = uwImage
                        }
                    }
                })
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

Here,

* We are importing the library `PhotosUI` using `import` keyword.
* Then, inside the class, we keep a variable `pickedImage` of type `UIImage` to store the picked image.
* **Inside the `pickPhotoFromGallery()` method:**
  * We create a configuration for the picker.
  * We are saying that we want to pick the images from the Gallery. You can modify it to pick Videos, GIFs, etc.
  * We write `configuration.selectionLimit = 1` to say that only one image can be selected from the Gallery. If you have used texting apps like WhatsApp or even Messages, you can see that you can select multiple images together and send them together in a message. PHPicker allows you to build similar functionalities. For our case, we need to select only one image.
  * Then we create the instance of `PHPickerViewController`, `photoPicker`with the configuration we created.
  * Then we set the `photoPicker`'s delegate to `self` to enable this screen to handle the PHPicker.
  * Then we present the `photoPicker` on the screen.
* **Adopting PHPickerViewControllerDelegate protocol:**
  * We must implement `didFinishPicking` method to handle the results. results contain the images we picked using the `photoPicker`.
  *   If you directly print the results, you should see something like the following:

      ```
      [PhotosUI.PHPickerResult(
          itemProvider: <PUPhotosFileProviderItemProvider: 0x600001091290> {
              types = (
                  "public.jpeg"
              )
          }, 
          assetIdentifier: nil, 
          __personIdentifier: nil)
      ]
      ```
  * Notice that it is a file structure. It creates a package of selected images in the 'itemProvider' directory. For example, I selected the "public.jpeg" image from the gallery, and the `photoPicker` sent the image with this package.
  * Now, we iterate through all the images inside the package and **asynchronously** fetch the images and deal with them. Since we have only one image, we set the image to `pickedImage`.
  * You might get confused by seeing:
  * ```swift
    self.addExpenseScreen.buttonTakePhoto.setImage(
        uwImage.withRenderingMode(.alwaysOriginal),
        for: .normal
    )
    ```
  * Here we are setting the image rendering mode to `alwaysOriginal` for setting the image for `buttonTakePhoto`. We set a specific rendering mode because iOS sets a tint on top of the images inside a button. That would ruin the original image. To remove the tinting effect, we set the rendering mode to `alwaysOriginal`. _Try removing the rendering mode, and see the tinting effect._

Alright! We are done setting up the PHPicker, and now it's time to test the app.
