# 6. UIMenu, Picking Images from Gallery and Camera, and UIImageView

## App6: Adding more features on App5

Let's create a new project, "App6." Add all the codes from the current "App5." For your convenience, download the project from here:

{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/App6_initial (1).zip" %}

Our goal here is to:

* Learn to use UIMenu instead of PickerView.
* Add an ImageView to the TableView Cell to display the expense receipt.
* Add options to take a photo of the receipt using the camera or gallery.

App6 would look something like this:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/6.1.one (1).gif" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
