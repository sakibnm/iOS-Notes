# 6.6. Using Camera: UIImagePickerController

Now it's time to build the final part of the app: integrating the camera to take a photo.

<mark style="color:red;">**Please note: the camera doesn't work in the emulator; you need a physical iOS device to test it. Do not worry; picking images using the camera is not mandatory in this course. This is an example for your future reference.**</mark>

So, let's open AddExpenseViewController.swift file. We will write codes in `pickUsingCamera()` method. We also need to adopt `UINavigationControllerDelegate`, and `UIImagePickerControllerDelegate` protocols using the `extension` keyword. Let's add the following code in AddExpenseViewController.swift file:

```swift
//
//  AddExpenseViewController.swift
//  App6
//
//  Created by Sakib Miazi on 5/18/23.
//

//codes omitted...

class AddExpenseViewController: UIViewController {
    //codes omitted...
    
    //MARK: variable to store the picked Image...
    var pickedImage:UIImage?
    
    //Codes omitted...
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
       //codes omitted...
        
        //MARK: adding menu to buttonTakePhoto...
        addExpenseScreen.buttonTakePhoto.menu = getMenuImagePicker()
        
        //codes omitted...
    }
    
    //codes omitted...
    
    func getMenuImagePicker() -> UIMenu{
        var menuItems = [
            UIAction(title: "Camera",handler: {(_) in
                self.pickUsingCamera()
            }),
            UIAction(title: "Gallery",handler: {(_) in
                self.pickPhotoFromGallery()
            })
        ]
        
        return UIMenu(title: "Select source", children: menuItems)
    }
    
    //codes omitted...
    
    //MARK: take Photo using Camera...
    func pickUsingCamera(){
        let cameraController = UIImagePickerController()
        cameraController.sourceType = .camera
        cameraController.allowsEditing = true
        cameraController.delegate = self
        present(cameraController, animated: true)
    }
    //codes omitted...

}

//codes omitted...

//MARK: adopting required protocols for UIImagePicker...
extension AddExpenseViewController: UINavigationControllerDelegate, UIImagePickerControllerDelegate{
    func imagePickerController(_ picker: UIImagePickerController, didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo info: [UIImagePickerController.InfoKey : Any]) {
        picker.dismiss(animated: true)
        
        if let image = info[.editedImage] as? UIImage{
            self.addExpenseScreen.buttonTakePhoto.setImage(
                image.withRenderingMode(.alwaysOriginal),
                for: .normal
            )
            self.pickedImage = image
        }else{
            // Do your thing for No image loaded...
        }
    }
}
```

Here we can see using a camera is pretty straightforward.

#### Inside pickUsingCamera() method:

* We create an instance of `UIImagePickerController` named `cameraController`.
* Then we set the source type of the controller to the camera. (This controller was also used to pick gallery images; however, Apple deprecated sources other than the camera for this controller).
* Then we allow cropping and editing after the user takes the photo.
* We set the camera delegate to `self` to handle the images after they are picked.
* Then we present the camera.

**Adopting UINavigationControllerDelegate and UIImagePickerControllerDelegate protocol:**

* We must implement the `imagePickerController()` method corresponding to `didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo`.
* First, we must dismiss the picker; otherwise, iOS will not close the camera app.
* Then we unwrap the image we took and edited.
* Finally, we set it to `pickedImage`.

### Changing the privacy settings of the App to allow the app to access the Camera

You need to update the privacy description for Camera Usage in the app 'Info' configurations.

* Click on 'Info' from the left pane.
* Right-click on the empty space
* Select "Add Row."
* Find "Privacy - Camera Usage Description."
* Add "We need to use the camera to take the receipt of the expense." as your justification for the user to access the camera.

Now let's run the app. I ran the app on my iPad to demonstrate it is working.
