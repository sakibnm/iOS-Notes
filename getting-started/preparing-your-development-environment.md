# Preparing your Development Environment

### <mark style="color:red;">You cannot build native iOS apps in Windows or Linux OSs.</mark>

### <mark style="color:red;">I recommend using a Macbook or an Apple Computer for this course. You do not need an iPhone/iPad for this course. If you do not have a Macbook, you can try MacInCloud, or even try borrowing Macbooks from the library (I am not sure how long you can borrow a computer from there). You can even talk to Khoury Systems to check if they lend Macbooks for a semester.</mark>

### <mark style="color:red;">MacInCloud could be unstable for you if you do not have a reliable Internet connection. So try it (they give you a day for $0.99) as soon as you register for the course. If it works for you, continue this course, or else talk to me</mark><mark style="color:blue;">.</mark>

**If you are a Mac computer (Macbooks, iMacs, or Mac Pros) user, jump directly to**[setting-up-xcode.md](setting-up-xcode.md "mention").

**If you are not a Mac user, you can still take the course; however, you must pay a monthly fee (around $50) to rent a cloud Mac VM.** **Please note Northeastern does not provide this VM.**

## Mac In Cloud

There are a few options to rent a cloud MacOS VM, like, Mac Stadium, AWS, and Mac in Cloud. I personally prefer **Mac In Cloud** ([https://macincloud.com](https://www.macincloud.com)). Please watch the following video to set up a Mac In Cloud instance and start using it on your Windows or Linux computer.
