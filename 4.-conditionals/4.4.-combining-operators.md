# 4.4. Combining operators

Swift has two operators that let us combine multiple conditions. They are `&&` (`and`), and `||` (or).

Let's look into an example:

```swift
let myAge = 24

if myAge >= 18 && myAge <= 65 {
    print("Eligible for the user study!")
}

if myAge < 18 || myAge > 65 {
    print("Not eligible!")
}
```

It means if `myAge` is more than or equal to 18 `and` less than or equal to 65, print "Eligible for the user study!"; if `myAge` is less than 18 `or` greater than 65, print "Not eligible!"
