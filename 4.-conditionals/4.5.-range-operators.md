# 4.5. Range operators

Swift can even represent a range of values. There are two kinds of range operators in Swift:

* Closed range operators (`...`) creates ranges up to and including the final value.
* Half-open range operators (`..<`) creates ranges up to and excluding the final value.

For example, the range `1..5` contains the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. In contrast, the range `1..<5` contains the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.

The ranges are most useful in `switch` statements. For example, let's revisit the week example from before. We can write the following code:

```swift
let today = 8

switch today{
    case 1...5:
        print("Weekday!")
    case 6..<8:
        print("Weekend!")
    default:
        print("Invalid day!")
}
```

It means that if the value of `today` is in the range 1 to 5 (including 5), `today` is a weekday; if the value is in the range 6 to less than 8, `today` is a weekend; else it is an invalid day.
