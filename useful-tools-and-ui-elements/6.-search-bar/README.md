# 6. Search Bar

The Search Bar in iOS is a very common UI element, and it is very useful to filter or search data from a list of data. In this module, we will build a demo app with a search bar. The app would look like the following:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/6.one (1).gif" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The app will have the following:

* A list of names.
* A table view to display the names.
* A search bar to filter the names.
  * For example, if the user types something on the search bar and any name contains that text, it will filter out those names containing the text.

So let's create a new app named "SearchBarDemo."
