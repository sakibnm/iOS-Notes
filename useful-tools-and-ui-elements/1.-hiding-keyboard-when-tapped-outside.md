# 1. Hiding Keyboard when tapped outside

When you are building iOS apps, you might have noticed that if you put some texts into TextFields, the emulator/phone keyboard doesn't disappear if you tap outside the keyboard automatically, like this:

Now if we want to hide the keyboard, it is very simple. Inside the ViewController of a Screen, add the following code in `viewDidLoad()` method:

```swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    
    //MARK: recognizing the taps on the app screen, not the keyboard...
    let tapRecognizer = UITapGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: #selector(hideKeyboardOnTap))
    view.addGestureRecognizer(tapRecognizer)

}


//MARK: Hide Keyboard...
@objc func hideKeyboardOnTap(){
    //MARK: removing the keyboard from screen...
    view.endEditing(true)
}
```

Here, we create a gesture recognizer that recognizes that the user taps on the app screen. Then we add the recognizer to the view. Then we add the action (`@objc func hideKeyboardOnTap()`) for reacting to that gesture that would hide the keyboard. The end result is:
