# 7.1. Closures with parameters

We can take the help of `in` keyword to pass parameters in a closure. For example, in the following code, we define a closure to take a person's name as a parameter and say hello to them:

```swift
let sayHelloTo = { (name:String) in
    print("Hello \(name)!")
}

//calling closure with parameter...
sayHelloTo("Donald")
```

It prints:

```
Hello Donald!
```

Do you find a difference between functions and closure in handling the parameter labels? :wink:
