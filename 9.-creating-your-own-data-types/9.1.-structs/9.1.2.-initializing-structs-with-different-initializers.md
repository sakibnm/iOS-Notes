# 9.1.2. Initializing structs with different initializers

We can define multiple initializers in a struct. At this point, we will define a new struct `Car` to demonstrate this concept. Let's define `Car`:

```swift
struct Car{
    var make:String
    var model:String
    var year:Int
    
    init(){
        make = "Not set"
        model = "Not set"
        year = 0
    }
}

//creating an instance of Car...
var car = Car()

//printing the instance...
print(car)

```

It prints:

```
Car(make: "Not set", model: "Not set", year: 0)
```

Here, we can see that all the default values were set when we created the instance.

Now, let's define another custom `init()` method along with the default one. This custom `init()` will accept parameters when we are creating the instance.

```swift
struct Car{
    var make:String
    var model:String
    var year:Int
    
    //default init...
    init(){
        make = "Not set"
        model = "Not set"
        year = 0
    }
    //custom init...
    init(make:String, model:String, year:Int) {
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year
    }
}
```

_<mark style="color:purple;">Do you see the</mark>_ _<mark style="color:purple;">`self`</mark>_ _<mark style="color:purple;">keyword? What do you think it is? -</mark>_ `self` is used to refer to the current instance of `Car`. See, we are using the same names for the parameters the method accepts as the properties of `Car`. By writing `self.make = make`, we are instructing the program to set the value of the current instance's `make` property to the value of the parameter `make` accepted by the `init()` method.

Now, we can create an instance of `Car` by calling the new `init(make:String, model:String, year:Int)` method. Let's try:

```swift
//creating an instance of Car using the custom init()...
var car2 = Car(make: "Toyota", model: "Corolla", year: 2020)
print(car2)
```

It prints:

```
Car(make: "Toyota", model: "Corolla", year: 2020)
```

So yes! We can create instances of a struct using multiple `init()` methods.

### Struct initialization and Optionals

Let's continue with the same `Car` example. Let's assume that when we are creating an instance of `Car` struct, we only want to set the values for two parameters, `make` and `model`, and keep the value of `year` empty. We can write a new `init()` method like:

```swift
init(make:String, model:String){
    self.make = make
    self.model = model
    //year is left uninitialized...
}
```

If we add this method, we will see an error:

So it is saying that we need to initialize all stored properties (`year` is not initialized). Now, how can we initialize `make` and `model` without initializing `year`?

Remember **Optional?**

Yes, we can declare `year` as an Optional like the following:

```swift
struct Car{
    var make:String
    var model:String
    var year:Int? //Optional
    
    //omitted other codes...
    init(make:String, model:String){
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
    }
}
```

Now that we do not have the error anymore, we can create an instance of `Car` and initialize it:

```swift
//creating an instance of Car...
var car3 = Car(make: "Honda", model: "Civic")
print(car3)
//prints: Car(make: "Honda", model: "Civic", year: nil)

//Assigning a value of year after we create the instance
car3.year = 2022
print(car3)
//prints: Car(make: "Honda", model: "Civic", year: Optional(2022))

```

Do you see an issue? `year` is wrapped with Optional. So if you want to use it anywhere, we should use an unwrapping technique like [if-let](../../8.-optionals.md).
