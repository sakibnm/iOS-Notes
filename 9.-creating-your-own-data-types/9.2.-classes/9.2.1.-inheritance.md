# 9.2.1. Inheritance

**One of the most critical capabilities that a class has but a struct doesn't have is inheritance.** Inheritance is the ability of a class to inherit the properties of another existing class and add more functionalities along with it. In other words, we can build a new class based on another existing class. For example, we can build a new class `Car` based on the `Vehicle` class we have:

```swift
//The Vehicle class....
class Vehicle{
    var type:String
    
    init(type:String){
        self.type = type
    }
    
}
// defining a new class inheriting Vehicle class
class Car:Vehicle{
    var make:String
    var model:String
    
    init(type:String, make:String, model:String) {
        //initializing this instance's properties...
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        
        //Calling super class's initializer...
        super.init(type: type)
    }
}
```

Here, we are doing a few things:

* Using `:` we are saying that `Car` inherits properties from an existing class `Vehicle`. In this case, `Vehicle` is the super class of `Car`.
* We added two properties `make` and `model` in `Car` class. Hence, we now have three properties in `Car` class: `type` (inherited from `Vehicle`), `make`, and `model`.
* We need to write our own `init()` method for each class we write. So, `Car` and `Vehicle` both have their own initializers. Think about the initializer of class `Car`. The `Car` class has it's own properties, so we need to initialize them. Also, we need to initialize the super class `Vehicle` inside `Car`'s initializer. That is what we are doing in the `init()` function inside `Car`. We use `super` keyword is used to access the super class `Vehicle`'s properties.

### Overriding methods

Let's define a method `describe()` inside the class `Vehicle` which prints a string.

```swift
class Vehicle{
    var type:String
    
    init(type:String){
        self.type = type
    }
    
    //method describing a Vehicle...
    func describe(){
        print("This is a \(type).")
    }
    
}
// creating an instance of class Vehicle...
var vehicle = Vehicle(type: "Car")

vehicle.describe() // prints: This is a Car.
```

Now, let's create an instance of the `Car` class, and call `describe()` method it inherited from `Vehicle`.

```swift
//creating an instance of Car...
var car = Car(type: "Car", make: "Toyota", model: "Rav4")

car.describe() //prints: This is a Car.
```

The thing is, it still just prints, "This is a Car." However, we have more information in class `Car,` like the `make` and `model` of the instance. What if we want to print more information?

We can override the method we inherited from the super class `Vehicle`. For example,

```swift
class Car:Vehicle{
    var make:String
    var model:String
    
    init(type:String, make:String, model:String) {
        //initializing this instance's properties...
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        
        //Calling super class's initializer...
        super.init(type: type)
    }
    
    //overriding super.describe()...
    override func describe() {
        print(
            """
            This is a \(type).
            It is a \(make) \(model).
            """
        )
    }
}

//creating an instance of Car...
var car = Car(type: "Car", make: "Toyota", model: "Rav4")
car.describe()
```

It prints:

```
This is a Car.
It is a Toyota Rav4.
```

This is called method overriding. A class not only can inherit a method from the superclass but also can change (override) it.
