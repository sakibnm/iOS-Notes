# 9.2.2. Value vs. Reference

Another major difference between a struct and a class is how they behave when copied. Structs are 'value types,' and classes are 'reference types.'

<mark style="color:purple;">**(Structs)**</mark> When you copy an instance of a struct from an existing instance, both instances work independently. For example:

```swift
struct User{
    var name:String
}

//creating an instance of User...
var user1 = User(name: "John Smith")

//copying the instance to a new instance...
var user2 = user1

//changing the name in the copied instance...
user2.name = "Bob Smith"

print(
    """
    User name of user1 = \(user1.name)
    User name of user2 = \(user2.name)
    """
)

```

It prints:

```
User name of user1 = John Smith
User name of user2 = Bob Smith
```

We copied the instance `user1` to another instance `user2`. When I changed the `name` in `user2` it did not have any effect on `user1`. They worked independent to each other. The data of the instances are independent and separate to each other.

<mark style="color:purple;">**(Classes)**</mark> However, classes are reference types. For example,

```swift
class Person{
    var name:String
    init(name:String){
        self.name = name
    }
}

//creating an instance of Person...
var person1 = Person(name: "John Snow")

//copying the instance to a new instance...
var person2 = person1

//changing the name in the copied instance...
person2.name = "Arya Stark"

print(
    """
    Name of person1 = \(person1.name)
    Name of person2 = \(person2.name)
    """
)
```

It prints:

```
Name of person1 = Arya Stark
Name of person2 = Arya Stark
```

Do you find the difference?

Here, we copied `person1` to `person2`. But when we changed the name of `person2`, it also changed the `name` of `person1`. So basically, the data is not separate for the two instances, they share the same data reference.
