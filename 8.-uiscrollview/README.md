# 8. UIScrollView

So far, we have worked with screens that do not scroll. I think all of you faced a similar issue: if you rotate the screen, the UI elements get outside the bottom edge. The reason behind it is that the screen is not scrollable. So here, we will implement a scrollable view.

Let's build a small app App8 to implement a ScrollView. The app should look like this:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/8.11 (1).gif" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**So there will be the following UI elements:**

* One text field at the top (`textField1`).
* Next, we will have a large image covering almost the whole screen.
* Then two more text fields at the bottom (`textField1` and `textField2`).
