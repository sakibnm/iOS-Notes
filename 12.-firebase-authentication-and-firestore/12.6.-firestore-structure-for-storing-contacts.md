# 12.6. Firestore Structure for Storing Contacts

At this point, our authentication service is working great. Now have to design our Firestore structure to accommodate a contacts list for each user.

So, we can design the Firestore database with the following structure:

* Root Document
  * users (collection)
    * user1 (document)
      * contacts (collection)
        * contact1 (document)
        * contact2 (document)
        * contact3 (document)
        * ...
    * user2 (document)
    * user3 (document)
    * ...

We have multiple users, and each user has a list of contacts. Hence, in the above structure:

1. We have a collection named "users" in our root document, where we store the users (authenticated with FirebaseAuth) as documents.
2. Each user document will hold a collection named "contacts" to store that user's contact.
3. In the "contacts" collection, we have all the contact documents.
4. If you are confused, please revisit the video here: [#firestore-data-structure](./#firestore-data-structure "mention").

When we implement the functionalities in our app, we need to make sure we store and retrieve data following the above Firestore structure.
