# 14. UIMapKit: Working with Location and Maps

In this module, we will learn how to use location services in iOS and build a few basic utilities of UIMapKit. Our end goal is to search places nearby on a Map View and navigate to the selected place using Apple Maps.

Let's create a new project on XCode and name it App14.
